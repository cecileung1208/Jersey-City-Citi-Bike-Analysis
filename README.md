# Jersey-City-Citibank-Analysis

## Background

The purpose of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the Jersey City Citi Bike program.  We have identified key trends and characteristics for each borough.  Then, interactive maps are created to determine room-type rates for each neighbourhoodand and the locations of all the listings.  To do this, We must obtain datasets from external sources, perform an analysis by using HTML, Javascript, Plotly, and Leaflet to display interactive visualizations and deploy it in the Heroku web application.

Using Tableau to create dashboards and a story to analyze trends and patterns of during 2016-2020
